# FTC-autoWriter

The purpose of this student developed project is to make the development of a autonoumous program for FIRST Tech Challenge easier.

The program does this by displaying an image of the screen on which the user can place points.
These points can then be moved around edited and deleted.
The users can save the current screen to work with later, or export the points as code(export coming soon).
The code will be exported as a opmode for the programer to add to their robot controller app.  
The robot should follow the path laid out by the points in the program.

To open in netbeans, android studio, or intellij idea, use the built in tool to open projects with git and use "https://github.com/archerD/FTC-autoWriter.git" as the repository to clone.
For more detailed instructions, see Contributing.md or the wiki.
